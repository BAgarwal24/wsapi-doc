# Order lifecycle

The API allows to create, modify or cancel orders through the `npid:private_orders` channels. It is done by sending a `request` type message with an [`OrderBatch`](orderbatch.md) as the payload.

## Acting on orders

### Order creation

The `type` of the `OrderBatch` is `Creation`.

On the `PrivateOrder` objects, some fields are mandatory, some are not needed.

## Order lifecycle: `state` and `action`

Throughout the life of an order, its `clientIdentifier` remains the same. It can be used as the primary identifier for the order.
The `idenitifier` and the `revisionNumber` identify the order at NordPool. Note that the same order can change `identifier` if it is modified.
The `state` shows the status of the order in the system and `action` shows how it got into this state.

Note that you will receive on a `npid:private_orders` channel reports for all the orders made by you or your company as a market participant. You will need to use the `clientIdentifier` to keep track of your own orders.

Here are the lists of the different events you will receive after each of the different actions.

For the event numbers below, the letter indicates different possibilities.

### Order creation

| Event | clientIdentifier   | identifier | revisionNumber | state        | action      | correlation        | Comment                                                                          |

| 1     | Same as in request | no value   | no value       | `Pending`    | `UserAdded` | Same as in request | Acknowledgement                                                                  |
| 2a    | Same as in request | new value  | 1              | `Active`     | `UserAdded` |                    | Order is on screen                                                               |

| 2c    | Same as in request | -          | -              | `Rejected`   | `UserAdded` |                    | Order has been rejected                                                          |

### Order modification

| 2a    | Same as in request | new value          | 1                    | `Active`   | `UserAdded`    |                    | Order position in orderbook changed, NPID created a new order   |
| 2b    | Same as in request | Same as in request | Value in request + 1 | `Active`   | `UserModified` |                    | Order position in orderbook has not changed                     |
| 2c    | Same as in request | Same as in request | Same as in request   | `Rejected` | `UserModified` |                    | Order modification has been rejected                            |
| 3a    | Same as in request | Same as in request | Value in request + 1 | `Inactive` | `UserAdded`    |                    | Order position in orderbook changed, NPID removed the old order |

Note that the sequence of the different events is not guaranteed. You can receive event #3 before event #2.
