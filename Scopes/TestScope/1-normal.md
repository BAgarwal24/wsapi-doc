# Normal events channel

### What is it?

The normal events channel will output an event every 200 ms.
The sequences of the events in a stream will look like this:

```
1 -- 2 -- 3 -- 4 -- 5 -- 6 -- 7 -- 8 -- 9 -- 10 -- ...
```

## What can I use it for?

This channel can be used to test the normal behaviour of the WebSocket API, for example how the connection is working, the authentication, etc.
